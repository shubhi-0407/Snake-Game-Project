🐍 Snake Game

This repository hosts a Python-based implementation of the **classic Snake Game** developed using the **Pygame library**. The project recreates the nostalgic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow in size, and score points. The main challenge is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body. This project is created to be **beginner-friendly** while also serving as an engaging practice task for programmers who want to strengthen their skills in Python and basic game development.  

🎮 Game Features

- Smooth movement using arrow keys for intuitive controls  
- Random food generation across the playing grid  
- Automatic scoring system that increases as food is eaten  
- Clear **game over detection** when the snake hits itself or the boundaries  
- Well-structured Python code that can be easily extended  

This repository is especially suited for **students, hobbyists, or Python beginners**. It offers a practical introduction to loops, conditionals, event handling, collision detection, and graphics. Additionally, the code is written in a simple format, making it easy to customize and expand. Users can enhance the game by adding features like increasing speed over time, background music, difficulty levels, or different types of food with varying scores.
